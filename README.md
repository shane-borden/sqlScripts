# DBMS SQL Scripts for Postgres / Oracle / SQLServer
by Shane Borden

Version 0.1.1

These scripts have been collected and modified to help diagnose and expose metadata about various DBMS Products

This SQL Script Toolkit is a "free to use" script (Covered by the Apache 2.0 License) 
that collects diagnostic Information from the target DBMS System.

Some of the scripts contained in this collection have been modified from other scripts available in the public domain.  Every effort has been made to credit original authors where practical.

## Steps

1. Connect to your target dbms
2. Execute the SQL File against the target and use the resultant information as necessary!
